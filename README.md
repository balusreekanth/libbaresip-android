libbaresip-android
==================

This project shows how to build libbaresip for Android on Debian 11 using Android NDK. Resulting libbaresip can be used in Baresip based Android (Studio) applications.

## Step 0 - download Android NDK

Download and unzip Android NDK for Linux from:
```
https://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads/
```
or use ndk bundle that comes with latest Android Studio.

## Step 1 - clone libbaresip-android

Clone libbaresip-android repository:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/juha-h/libbaresip-android.git
```
This creates libbaresip-android directory containing Makefile.

## Step 2 - edit Makefile

Go to ./libbaresip-android directory and edit Makefile. You need to set (or check) the variables listed in VALUES TO CONFIGURE section.

## Step 3 - download source code

Download source code to ./libbaresip-android directory:
```
$ make download-sources
```
This will also patch re and baresip as needed by baresip-studio project.

## Step 4 - build and install libraries

You can build and install the libraries only for a selected architecture with command:
```
$ make install ANDROID_TARGET_ARCH=$ARCH
```
by replacing $ARCH with armeabi-v7a or arm64-v8a.

Or you can build and install the libraries for all architectures with command:
```
$ make install-all
```
